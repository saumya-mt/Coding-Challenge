# TypeScript Event Management System

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Event management systems often struggle with scalability, type safety, and maintainable code structure. The challenge was to create a robust RSVP system that could handle concurrent responses while maintaining data integrity.

## 💡 Solution
A scalable, type-safe RSVP management service built with TypeScript, following clean architecture principles and domain-driven design.

### Key Features
- ✨ Type-safe RSVP handling
- 🔄 Concurrent response management
- 📊 Real-time attendance tracking
- 🔐 Data integrity protection
- 📈 Scalable architecture

### Technical Implementation
#### 1. Core Domain
```typescript
interface RsvpResponse {
    userId: string;
    status: 'Yes' | 'No' | 'Maybe';
    timestamp: Date;
}

class RsvpService {
    async updateResponse(userId: string, status: RsvpStatus): Promise<void>;
    async getConfirmedAttendees(): Promise<User[]>;
    async getResponseCounts(): Promise<ResponseCounts>;
}
```

#### 2. Clean Architecture
- Domain Layer: Core business logic
- Application Layer: Use cases
- Infrastructure Layer: External concerns
- Interface Layer: API endpoints

#### 3. Design Patterns
- Repository Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Command Pattern
